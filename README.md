# Serde presentation

This repository contains the code for the `serde` talk I will be presenting at
the Rust meetup in Lyon at some point in the next few weeks.

It contains a made language called "POBL" (Paul's Obviously Better Language).

**This language is a joke, do not use it!**

If you choose to use it anyways, have fun and ping me on [Mastodon](https://metalhead.club/@pohl)!
